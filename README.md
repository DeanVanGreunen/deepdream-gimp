## The need

In recent years there has been a dearth of deep learning algorithms and techniques, including many that can be used for artistic purposes, such as Deepdream, neural style transfer, and more. However, many of these still require a significant amount of technical skill to use, making them inaccessible to the vast majority of artists who would potentially use them

## The project

We will develop an artist-friendly, yet powerful interface for the Deepdream algorithm, possibly built around a Gimp or Photoshop plug in, thus integrating the software into tools artists already know how to use.

## Sponsor

We do not have a sponsor yet, however we have plans to reach out to the SMFA to find interested potential sponsors.
