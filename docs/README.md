## The need

In recent years there has been a dearth of deep learning algorithms and techniques, including many that can be used for artistic purposes, such as Deepdream, neural style transfer, and more. However, many of these still require a significant amount of technical skill to use, making them inaccessible to the vast majority of artists who would potentially use them

## The project

We will develop an artist-friendly, yet powerful interface for the Deepdream algorithm, possibly built around a Gimp or Photoshop plug in, thus integrating the software into tools artists already know how to use.

## Sponsor

Our sponsor is Rick Roelke, founder of Metlogix Inc., a company that works with metrology software for video and optical measuring systems. His experience with user interfaces as well fine arts makes him a great customer for our product, and he will offer guidance on feature design and the overall user experience.
